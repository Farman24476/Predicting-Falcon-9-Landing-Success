# 🚀 **Predicting Falcon 9 Landing Success**

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict the success of Falcon 9 first-stage landings using real-world data from the **SpaceX API**. The goal is to identify key factors—such as **payload mass**, **launch site**, and **booster version**—that influence successful landings and apply predictive models to forecast outcomes.
