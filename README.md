ðŸš€ Predicting Falcon 9 Landing Success
This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline to predict the success of Falcon 9 first-stage landings using real-world data from the SpaceX API. The goal is to identify key factorsâ€”such as payload mass, launch site, and booster versionâ€”that influence successful landings and apply predictive models to forecast outcomes.
