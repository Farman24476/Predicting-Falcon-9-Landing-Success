# Project: **Predicting Falcon 9 Landing Success**

# Overview of the Project

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict the success of Falcon 9 first-stage landings using real-world data from the SpaceX API. The goal is to identify key factors—such as payload mass, launch site, and booster version—that influence successful landings and apply predictive models to forecast outcomes.

## Key Features

- Data Collection: SpaceX API integration for real-time launch data  
- Data Wrangling: Cleaning, feature engineering, and handling of missing values  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visual insights via interactive maps (Folium), dashboards (Plotly Dash), and advanced visualizations  

---

## Machine Learning Models

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree (Best performer with 96% accuracy)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

---

## Model Evaluation

Models are evaluated using:

- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score  
- Confusion Matrix  

---

## Visual Insights

- Folium: Interactive maps for launch site success rates  
- Plotly Dash: Dashboards with key metrics and trends  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Statistical visualization  

---

## Key Findings

- Payload mass negatively correlates with landing success  
- Specific launch sites show higher success rates  
- Decision Tree achieved the highest performance  
- Newer booster versions had better outcomes
